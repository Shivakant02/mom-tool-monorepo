00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:06.430
<v Sarah Chen>Alright everyone, let's get started. Thanks for joining today's sprint planning meeting. We have a lot to cover.</v>

3cc9ead7-2d2d-485a-8927-410835bc28fb/2-0
00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:13.650
<v Sarah Chen>As you know, we're heading into the final three weeks before the 2.5 release, so we need to prioritize our remaining tasks and address any blockers.</v>

3cc9ead7-2d2d-485a-8927-410835bc28fb/3-0
00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:19.860
<v Marcus Johnson>Before we dive in, I wanted to mention that I've resolved the caching issue we discussed last week.</v>

3cc9ead7-2d2d-485a-8927-410835bc28fb/4-0
00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:28.730
<v Marcus Johnson>The performance tests are showing a 40% improvement in response time. I've pushed the changes to the development branch if anyone wants to take a look.</v>

3cc9ead7-2d2d-485a-8927-410835bc28fb/5-0
00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.910
<v Priya Patel>That's great news, Marcus! I'll review the code later today.</v>

3cc9ead7-2d2d-485a-8927-410835bc28fb/6-0
00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:41.290
<v Sarah Chen>Excellent work, Marcus. Priya, can you take a look at it by tomorrow afternoon? It's not very complex, shouldn't take more than an hour.</v>

3cc9ead7-2d2d-485a-8927-410835bc28fb/7-0
00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.180
<v Priya Patel>Yes, I can do that, no problem.</v>

3cc9ead7-2d2d-485a-8927-410835bc28fb/8-0
00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:52.430
<v Sarah Chen>Great. Just make sure to log any issues you find in Jira so Marcus can address them before the end of the week.</v>

3cc9ead7-2d2d-485a-8927-410835bc28fb/9-0
00:00:53.120 --> 00:01:03.450
<v Sarah Chen>Moving on to our main agenda items. The first critical feature we need to complete is the new authentication system. David, can you give us an update on where we stand?</v>

3cc9ead7-2d2d-485a-8927-410835bc28fb/10-0
00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:14.570
<v David Kim>Sure. I've implemented the OAuth 2.0 integration, but I'm still having some issues with the token refresh mechanism. I think I'll need another three days to get it fully working.</v>

3cc9ead7-2d2d-485a-8927-410835bc28fb/11-0
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:21.640
<v David Kim>The main challenge is handling token expiration gracefully without disrupting the user experience.</v>

3cc9ead7-2d2d-485a-8927-410835bc28fb/12-0
00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:28.710
<v Marcus Johnson>David, I faced a similar issue on my previous project. I can sit with you after this meeting to share how we solved it.</v>

3cc9ead7-2d2d-485a-8927-410835bc28fb/13-0
00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.980
<v David Kim>That would be incredibly helpful, thanks Marcus.</v>

3cc9ead7-2d2d-485a-8927-410835bc28fb/14-0
00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:40.220
<v Sarah Chen>Great collaboration, team. David, try to wrap up that OAuth token refresh by next Tuesday, okay? We need to leave enough time for testing.</v>

3cc9ead7-2d2d-485a-8927-410835bc28fb/15-0
00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.650
<v David Kim>Got it. I'll have it done by Tuesday afternoon, assuming there are no major roadblocks.</v>

3cc9ead7-2d2d-485a-8927-410835bc28fb/16-0
00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.470
<v Sarah Chen>And Marcus, can you sit with David today after the meeting? Maybe around 2 PM?</v>

3cc9ead7-2d2d-485a-8927-410835bc28fb/17-0
00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.830
<v Marcus Johnson>Yeah, my calendar's clear after 2. Works for me.</v>

3cc9ead7-2d2d-485a-8927-410835bc28fb/18-0
00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:02.270
<v Priya Patel>While we're on the authentication topic, I've noticed our error messages to users aren't very helpful. Can we improve those as part of this release?</v>

3cc9ead7-2d2d-485a-8927-410835bc28fb/19-0
00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:10.590
<v Sarah Chen>Good point, Priya. Do you think you could take that on? Maybe talk to the UX team about the wording?</v>

3cc9ead7-2d2d-485a-8927-410835bc28fb/20-0
00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:16.840
<v Priya Patel>Sure, I can handle that. I'll have something ready by the end of next week.</v>

3cc9ead7-2d2d-485a-8927-410835bc28fb/21-0
00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:25.280
<v Sarah Chen>Perfect. Next on our agenda is the new dashboard feature. Marcus, you're leading this effort. How's it coming along?</v>

3cc9ead7-2d2d-485a-8927-410835bc28fb/22-0
00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:37.390
<v Marcus Johnson>The basic structure is in place. I've implemented the widget framework and data fetching layer. Now we need to build the individual visualization components and connect them to the API.</v>

3cc9ead7-2d2d-485a-8927-410835bc28fb/23-0
00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:47.450
<v Marcus Johnson>I was hoping we could split up the visualization work. There are five main components, and it would speed things up if we divide them among the team.</v>

3cc9ead7-2d2d-485a-8927-410835bc28fb/24-0
00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.780
<v David Kim>I can take on the metrics chart once I finish the authentication work.</v>

3cc9ead7-2d2d-485a-8927-410835bc28fb/25-0
00:02:53.440 --> 00:03:01.170
<v Priya Patel>I'd be happy to handle the user activity timeline. That aligns well with the work I did on the reporting module last sprint.</v>

3cc9ead7-2d2d-485a-8927-410835bc28fb/26-0
00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:08.570
<v Sarah Chen>I can work on the status overview widget. That leaves the resource allocation chart and the alerts panel.</v>

3cc9ead7-2d2d-485a-8927-410835bc28fb/27-0
00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:15.810
<v Marcus Johnson>I'll take those two. Can everyone get their components done by next Friday?</v>

3cc9ead7-2d2d-485a-8927-410835bc28fb/28-0
00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.260
<v David Kim>Should be doable.</v>

3cc9ead7-2d2d-485a-8927-410835bc28fb/29-0
00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.450
<v Priya Patel>Works for me.</v>

3cc9ead7-2d2d-485a-8927-410835bc28fb/30-0
00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:24.160
<v Sarah Chen>I'll add these assignments to our sprint board after the meeting.</v>

3cc9ead7-2d2d-485a-8927-410835bc28fb/31-0
00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:35.370
<v David Kim>I have a concern about the upcoming API changes. The backend team mentioned they're refactoring the endpoints we're using for the dashboard. Has anyone spoken with them about this?</v>

3cc9ead7-2d2d-485a-8927-410835bc28fb/32-0
00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.940
<v Sarah Chen>Good point, David. I wasn't aware of that. We need to coordinate with them.</v>

3cc9ead7-2d2d-485a-8927-410835bc28fb/33-0
00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:48.230
<v Marcus Johnson>I'll talk to Raj from the backend team tomorrow. Can find out what their timeline looks like.</v>

3cc9ead7-2d2d-485a-8927-410835bc28fb/34-0
00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:54.780
<v David Kim>I'd like to join that conversation since my work depends heavily on their APIs.</v>

3cc9ead7-2d2d-485a-8927-410835bc28fb/35-0
00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:02.860
<v Marcus Johnson>Sure, I'll set something up for tomorrow morning and send you a calendar invite.</v>

3cc9ead7-2d2d-485a-8927-410835bc28fb/36-0
00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:16.840
<v Sarah Chen>Let's move on to discuss our testing strategy for this release. We need to make sure we have comprehensive test coverage, especially for the new features.</v>

3cc9ead7-2d2d-485a-8927-410835bc28fb/37-0
00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:27.160
<v Priya Patel>I've been working on expanding our unit test suite. Currently, we're at about 78% coverage, but I'd like to get that above 85% before the release.</v>

3cc9ead7-2d2d-485a-8927-410835bc28fb/38-0
00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:35.620
<v Priya Patel>I've also set up the integration tests for the authentication flow, but we'll need similar tests for the dashboard.</v>

3cc9ead7-2d2d-485a-8927-410835bc28fb/39-0
00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:45.130
<v Marcus Johnson>I'll write the integration tests for the dashboard once all the components are in place. Should we also consider adding some end-to-end tests?</v>

3cc9ead7-2d2d-485a-8927-410835bc28fb/40-0
00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:56.450
<v David Kim>End-to-end tests would be valuable, especially for the critical user journeys. I can set up the framework and write a few examples, then we can all contribute.</v>

3cc9ead7-2d2d-485a-8927-410835bc28fb/41-0
00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:02.580
<v Sarah Chen>David, how long would it take you to set up that framework?</v>

3cc9ead7-2d2d-485a-8927-410835bc28fb/42-0
00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:10.520
<v David Kim>I can have it ready by next Thursday if I start after finishing the authentication work.</v>

3cc9ead7-2d2d-485a-8927-410835bc28fb/43-0
00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:16.940
<v Sarah Chen>That works. Priya, can you hit that 85% coverage target by the end of the month?</v>

3cc9ead7-2d2d-485a-8927-410835bc28fb/44-0
00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:21.450
<v Priya Patel>Yes, that shouldn't be a problem. I'll focus on the critical paths first.</v>

3cc9ead7-2d2d-485a-8927-410835bc28fb/45-0
00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:27.790
<v Sarah Chen>And Marcus, aim to have those dashboard integration tests done by the end of the month, okay?</v>

3cc9ead7-2d2d-485a-8927-410835bc28fb/46-0
00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:32.280
<v Marcus Johnson>Got it. I'll start once all the dashboard components are ready.</v>

3cc9ead7-2d2d-485a-8927-410835bc28fb/47-0
00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:48.790
<v Sarah Chen>Finally, let's talk about documentation. We need to update the developer docs for the new features and create user guides for the dashboard.</v>

3cc9ead7-2d2d-485a-8927-410835bc28fb/48-0
00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:57.280
<v Priya Patel>I can update the API documentation to reflect any changes. Should we involve the technical writing team for the user guides?</v>

3cc9ead7-2d2d-485a-8927-410835bc28fb/49-0
00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:05.870
<v Sarah Chen>Yes, definitely. I'll talk to Julia from the documentation team this week about collaborating on the user guides.</v>

3cc9ead7-2d2d-485a-8927-410835bc28fb/50-0
00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:12.280
<v David Kim>I'll handle the developer documentation for the authentication system once it's complete.</v>

3cc9ead7-2d2d-485a-8927-410835bc28fb/51-0
00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:20.710
<v Marcus Johnson>And I'll write up the technical details for the dashboard framework for the documentation team.</v>

3cc9ead7-2d2d-485a-8927-410835bc28fb/52-0
00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:27.160
<v Sarah Chen>Great, let's try to have all docs wrapped up by the first week of April.</v>

3cc9ead7-2d2d-485a-8927-410835bc28fb/53-0
00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:35.590
<v Priya Patel>That's fine for the API docs. I can have them ready by April 2nd if that works?</v>

3cc9ead7-2d2d-485a-8927-410835bc28fb/54-0
00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:40.630
<v Sarah Chen>That's perfect, Priya. David and Marcus, same timeframe work for you?</v>

3cc9ead7-2d2d-485a-8927-410835bc28fb/55-0
00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:45.170
<v David Kim>I can have the auth docs done by the end of the month.</v>

3cc9ead7-2d2d-485a-8927-410835bc28fb/56-0
00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:50.520
<v Marcus Johnson>Same here for the dashboard documentation.</v>

3cc9ead7-2d2d-485a-8927-410835bc28fb/57-0
00:06:51.190 --> 00:07:02.840
<v Sarah Chen>Great job, team. I think we have a solid plan for the final push to the 2.5 release. Any other concerns or issues we should discuss?</v>

3cc9ead7-2d2d-485a-8927-410835bc28fb/58-0
00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:08.270
<v David Kim>I'll be out next Tuesday morning for a doctor's appointment, just so everyone knows.</v>

3cc9ead7-2d2d-485a-8927-410835bc28fb/59-0
00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:11.970
<v Sarah Chen>Thanks for letting us know, David.</v>

3cc9ead7-2d2d-485a-8927-410835bc28fb/60-0
00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:21.390
<v Marcus Johnson>I've scheduled a demo of the dashboard framework for next Wednesday at 2 PM. Would be great if you all could attend and give feedback.</v>

3cc9ead7-2d2d-485a-8927-410835bc28fb/61-0
00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:24.790
<v Priya Patel>I've added it to my calendar. Looking forward to it.</v>

3cc9ead7-2d2d-485a-8927-410835bc28fb/62-0
00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:28.240
<v David Kim>I'll be there too. Will you send the meeting link?</v>

3cc9ead7-2d2d-485a-8927-410835bc28fb/63-0
00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:32.760
<v Marcus Johnson>Yeah, I'll send out a calendar invite right after this.</v>

3cc9ead7-2d2d-485a-8927-410835bc28fb/64-0
00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:40.180
<v Sarah Chen>Perfect. Let's meet again same time next week to check on our progress.</v>

3cc9ead7-2d2d-485a-8927-410835bc28fb/65-0
00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:46.580
<v Sarah Chen>Make sure to keep your Jira tickets updated as you go. Any final questions?</v>

3cc9ead7-2d2d-485a-8927-410835bc28fb/66-0
00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:52.860
<v Sarah Chen>Alright then. Thanks everyone for your time. Let's have a great sprint!</v>

3cc9ead7-2d2d-485a-8927-410835bc28fb/67-0
00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:55.290
<v Marcus Johnson>Thanks, Sarah. Bye everyone!</v>

3cc9ead7-2d2d-485a-8927-410835bc28fb/68-0
00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:57.740
<v Priya Patel>Thanks, bye!</v>

3cc9ead7-2d2d-485a-8927-410835bc28fb/69-0
00:07:58.410 --> 00:08:02.950
<v David Kim>Thanks for running the meeting, Sarah. Talk to you all later.</v>
